# L6-Stacks

Exercises for the implementation stack

**Task One**

Implement and test completely the following methods in Stack class, using an fixed size array in the internal implementation:

Stack() - constructor
isFull()
isEmpty()
push()
pop()
peek() - non-destructive look at top of the stack
print() - debug routine to print out the current state of the stack

Ensure you test stack underflow and overflow (using a small stack array!)

**Task Two**

Implement a simple stack based calculator which:
- Loops round until the user enters "exit"
- If the user enters an integer, push it on the stack
- If the user users a "+" or a "-", pop two items off the stack and push the result.

**Task Three**

Implement and test the methods in Task One using a list implementation (C# list collection or your own prior implementation)

**Task Four - Optional**

Create an abstract class _Stack()
Modify your implementations in Task One and Task Two to implement:
- StackA- inherits from _Stack
- StackL - inherits from _Stack

Test your StackL and StackA classes
