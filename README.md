# L6-Stacks

Exercises for the implementation stack

**Task One**

Implement and test completely the following methods in Stack class, using an fixed size array in the internal implementation:

Stack() - constructor
isFull()
isEmpty()
push()
pop()
peek() - non-destructive look at top of the stack
print() - debug routine to print out the current state of the stack


**Task Two**

Implement and test the methods in Task One using a list implmentation (C# list collection or your own prior implementation)

**Task Three - Optional**

Create an abstract class _Stack()
Modify your implementations in Task One and Task Two to implment:
- StackA- inherits from _Stack
- StackL - inherits from _Stack

Test your StackL and StackA classese
